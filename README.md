Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

The AI features in this application are powered by Google's Gemini models. You will need an API key to use them.

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project.
2.  Add the key to your `.env` file like this:

    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages for the project.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Servers

You need to run two separate processes for the application to work correctly:

1.  **Start the Next.js development server**:
    This runs the main web application.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Start the Genkit development service**:
    In a separate terminal, run this command to enable the AI features.
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

### 4. Open the Application

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser to see the result.

The main application code can be found in `src/app/page.tsx`.
